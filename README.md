# Template base includes:

- Nextjs
- Firebase
- Chakra UI
- Framer motion
- Tailwind CSS

### pages is where I put the logic/functions, the components are really just ui

** Even though the Signup component is the entire ui for the signup page, we can seperate the functions from that component to make things less messy. so all the functions will be on the page and passed to the component as props **
